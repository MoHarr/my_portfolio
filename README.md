# my_portfolio
This is my portfolio and my first attempt at creating a website. The point of this project was to create a portfolio that will be useful for job searching as well as to improve my javascript/html/css skills in the process. This website has a header bar and seven sections. Mobile support is coming soon!

# Files
## index.html
Contains the html code for the website.

## styles.css
Contains the styles for the elements of the html file.

## portfolio.js
Used for highlighting section tabs by selecting and for simple animations.
